# How to contribute?

You can submit your contribution in PDF (.pdf) or Markdown (.md) format via a pull request. The file name should be structured as follows:

All contributions **must**:

- Use the `English-UK.pdf` version as the base layer for the translation work,
- Contain the full version of the original `English-UK.pdf` paper - partial translations will not be merged,
- Be loyal to the contents of the original paper, with absolutely no alterations,
- Be submited either in PDF (.pdf) or Markdown (.md) and no other extensions will be accepted.

*Check if the translation to your language has been done already before submitting yours.*
